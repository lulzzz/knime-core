	<shortDescription>Extracts period or duration fields from period or	duration cells.</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Extracts the selected fields from a duration or period column and appends the values as integer or long
			columns. Valid fields are	hour, minute, second and nanosecond for a duration and year, month and
			day for a period. There are two modes: either breaks down the duration into its individuals by selecting
			several fields, or get the whole duration/period in a single number by selecting only a single field.

		<tab name="Column Selection">
			<option name="Column Selector">
				A Duration or Period column can be chosen.
			</option>
		</tab>
		<tab name="Field Selection">
			<option name="Single Value">
				A granularity can be selected to which the actual period or duration gets converted. The extracted value
				is truncated, e.g. from a duration holding 2 hours, 30 minutes and 15 seconds the node extracts either
				two hours, 150 minutes or 9015 seconds. The	extracted value will be appended as a new column.
			</option>
			<option name="Several Values">
				Several fields can be selected to extract. The duration or period gets broken down in its individual
				parts, e.g.	from a duration holding two hours, 30 minutes, and 15 seconds the node extracts (depending
				on the selection) three new columns containing two hours, 30 minutes, and 15 seconds, respectively.
